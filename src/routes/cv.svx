## Hobbies and Interests

When I'm not at work I love to get out where I can, whether that's on my motorbike for a ride around, or getting out on the water for a paddle around in a kayak.
If the weathers not looking as bright I like to play around with emerging technologies and see how I can fit them into my day to day work.
